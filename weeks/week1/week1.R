# week 1:
# building a simple script to do some probability calculations

# Write a function to simulate rolling two six-sided dice 
# 1,000 times. Count how often each possible outcome occurs.

# 1. We need to save the number of rolls.
# 2. Some way of simulating dice rolls (`?sample`).
# 3. We have two dice. Each die rolls a number. What are we interested in? The actual values, or the combined value?
# 4. Count outcome occurrences (i.e. make a frequency distribution, `?table`)
# 5. Visualise!

# 1. Save the number of rolls
n_rolls <- 1000
