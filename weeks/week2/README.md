# Week 2

After much deliberation, this week we'll work on data frames. They are probably the most important data structure in R as so much of what we deal with is tables.

We will use the following two tutorials I made a while back:
- https://aru-life-sciences.github.io/bioinformatics/R/programming/2_working_with_dataframes/htmls/reading_and_viewing.html
- https://aru-life-sciences.github.io/bioinformatics/R/programming/2_working_with_dataframes/htmls/indexing.html

Which are about reading in data, and extracting useful things from the data. As far as possible, I am going to try and do everything in base R (no packages), as we will look at packages later in the term.

As per usual, we will probably get distracted. We are using the `barley` dataset. See:

## Extra stuff (mainly stats!)

- `barley` has been used to investigate the paired T-test, which we could do.
- `barley` has different sites, could see if there are between site differences in yield?
- What about yield over time? A regression?
