# Week 3 coding club

Today we will look at writing and using functions. Please see:

For specific details.

We'll then look at how to implement your own functions. We will run through `mean` and `variance` together.

The mean is the sum of the samples divided by the number of samples.

The variance is the sum of squares of the samples ( sum (y - ybar) ^ 2 ) divided by the degrees of freedom (n - 1 in this case).

Try and implement these functions yourself. There are already R in-built functions for these important mathematical quantities.
